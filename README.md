# Sparkbox Apprenticeships

Sparkbox is a team that values education. We offer paid apprenticeships because we love what we do, we want to share with new talent, and we genuinely care about the future of the web. Expect to be challenged. Expect high expectations. Expect to get hit with a few Nerf darts.

## What We Look For

We build responsive, standards-compliant, content-focused, well-crafted, accessible, valuable, beautiful web sites and apps, and we're looking for some web geeks that want to do the same.
Passion, character, and initiative are a requirement. A long resumé is not — as long as you care about the right things, we can help build your skillset. This is true for those we hire, and it is equally true for our apprentices.

Through your apprenticeship, we hope to help develop you into the sort of individual we'd want to hire. And we may do just that.
We're looking primarily for those interested in an apprenticeship in web development — front-end, back-end, or anything code related. What we're looking for most, however, are individuals that are excited to make their mark on the web industry. In your application, provide anything and everything you can that will convince us you are that geek.

## What You'll Be Doing

In the first months of your apprenticeship, you'll be exposed to the core technologies of our work and work flow. Everyone, regardless of job title, will be brought to an understanding of Sparkbox's convictions on the priority of content, value of design, semantic HTML, and mobile-first CSS. You'll be exposed to our Github-centric project management, our deployment processes, best practices for clean code and separation of concerns, and unit testing techniques.
By the end of your apprenticeship, you'll be interacting as a full-fledged team member. Your confidence will be up, you'll have some work under your belt, and that's when the real fun begins.
