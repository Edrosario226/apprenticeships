1. Make a dotfiles directory and store any relevant dotfiles that you'll make changes to inside of that directory (e.g. .bash_profile, .bashrc, .gitconfig, .gitignore).
2. Initialize a new repository inside of your dotfiles directory.
3. Create symlinks for any dotfiles that you've moved from your root.
4. Add customizations to your dotfiles as you see fit.
5. Push dotfiles directory to GitHub.
